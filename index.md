My research is currently focused around zero forcing and its variants.  Particularly on applications to minimum rank, the inverse eigenvalue problem, and reconfiguration questions.  Zero forcing is a graph coloring game in which all vertices are initially assigned a color, either black or white.  The game evolves according to the color change rule, which depends on the zero forcing variant under consideration.  One common color change rule is that a white vertex becomes black if it is the unique white neighbor of some black vertex. This rule is applied until no more vertices can change color.

Of particular importance are the initial color assignments that result in all vertices black at the end of the game, and the minimum cardinality of such a set is called the zero forcing number of the graph G. This parameter is an upper bound on the maximum nullity among all matrices in with a zero-nonzero pattern defined by G. The minimum size of initial colorings that result in all vertices of G being black according to other color change rules define different graph parameters of G.
